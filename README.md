# ResNet_power_flow
You need to create an empty folder under the data/ path, which is used to save the trained model. The path should be consistent with the saveFile path shown in the Jupyter coding part. 

The model is proposed in the paper: Physics-guided residual learning for probabilistic power flow analysis, Kejun Chen and Yu Zhang.
